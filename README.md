# Data-Warehouse-Project

## Executive Summary of Project

The primary objective of this project is the implementation of Northwind Database Dimensional Modelling. The project has two fact tables and four-dimension tables. These table are created using the ETL process with the data being loaded from the source database to the data warehouse. The ETL process is done with help of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) tool.  We then create reports based on the data from our data warehouse using SQL Server Reporting Services (SRSS). The data visualization is done using R Programming Language. We can connect database from SQL Server with R to create various plots for data visualization. It gives easy to understand insights when compared to traditional reports. Finally, we implement a part of our source database as a graph database using Neo4j technology. 
 
## Source of Data

The data source used for this project is “Northwind Database”. The database is about a company called Northwind Traders which showcases the sales transactions between the company and its Customers. It also shows the relationship between the company and the Suppliers.
The Northwind Database is taken from Microsoft’s website which provides us with many sample databases to work with.

## Subject Areas – Overview

We can present various subject areas from the Northwind Database Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.  I have selected the potential business areas which can help to achieve the business goals with different approaches and perspectives.

## Order Distribution Analysis 

This analysis is about how much order sales is generated. The reason for selecting this subject area is to study orders distributed to customers around the globe, we can track order sales for each year and total number of order sales generated by each customer.
Tracking of customers sales and revenue generated per year can give meaningful insights to evaluate and increase the business turnover.
 

## Revenue Per Employee Analysis

This analysis is to know the employee generated revenue for the business. The contribution of the Employees is very much significant for the business therefore we need to keep track of employee’s performance from time to time. 
Using this analysis, we can give feedback to the employees accordingly. If the employee’s performance is good then we can appreciate them or if the employee’s performance is not good, then we can motivate them to do better and advise them accordingly.

## Stakeholders, Vision, Goals

Stakeholders: Employees, Owners, Suppliers, Creditors.  
Vision: The vision of this project is to grow the business with our best Order  Distribution and Revenue generated Per Employee analysis practices.  
Goals: The reports generated from this project will answer to questions like,  
“What is the company sales for a specific year? We can alter business plans for the upcoming year accordingly.”  
“What are the top selling products for the calendar year?”  
“Where are most of our customer from? So that we can target that specific region for marketing the business.”  
“What is the revenue generated by a particular customer? This will tell us which customers are more valuable to the business.”
